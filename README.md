### Log Monitoring and Analysis Script

This Python script (`log_monitor.py`) provides continuous monitoring of a specified log file for new entries in real time, performs basic log analysis, and generates summary reports based on specific keywords or patterns.

#### Main Features

- **Log File Monitoring**:
  - Monitors a specified log file for new entries using tail or similar commands.
  - Displays new log entries in real time.
  - Implements a mechanism to stop the monitoring loop (e.g., using Ctrl+C signal).

- **Log Analysis**:
  - Performs basic analysis on log entries by counting occurrences of specific keywords or patterns (e.g., error messages, HTTP status codes).
  - Generates summary reports, such as the top occurrences of specific keywords.

#### Additional Features

- **Time-based Analysis**:
  - Introduces analysis over a defined time window (e.g., last hour) to track trends and patterns in log entries within that timeframe.

- **Email Notifications**:
  - Incorporates email alerts for critical log events, notifying designated recipients when specific keywords or patterns (e.g., "ERROR") are detected in log entries.

#### Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Setup**:
   - Replace `"path/to/your/log/file.log"` in the script with the path to your log file.
   - Configure SMTP server details (`SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`) for email notifications (if using this feature).

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `log_monitor.py`.
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python log_monitor.py
     ```

4. **Monitoring Log File**:
   - The script will start monitoring the specified log file in real time.
   - New log entries will be displayed continuously.

5. **Stopping the Script**:
   - To stop the monitoring process, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

6. **Log Analysis**:
   - The script will analyze log entries by counting occurrences of predefined keywords or patterns.
   - It will generate summary reports based on the analysis, such as displaying top error messages or HTTP status codes.

#### Customization

- **Keywords to Count**:
  - Modify the `KEYWORDS_TO_COUNT` list in the script to specify the keywords or patterns you want to track and count in the log entries.

- **Summary Report Size**:
  - Adjust the `REPORT_SIZE` variable to control the number of top entries included in the summary report.

#### Notes

- Ensure that the specified log file (`LOG_FILE_PATH`) is accessible and has appropriate read permissions.
- Customize the script further based on specific log analysis requirements or additional functionalities.
